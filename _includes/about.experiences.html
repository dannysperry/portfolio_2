      <p>I started out as a junior developer working mostly with Ruby on Rails in 2013. I learned a lot about the RoR ecosystem and moved into a lead role. Near the end of 2014 I started working remotely full time. I gained a bit more responsibility on projects and was set up with a well balanced results first work environment.</p>

    <div class="from-me">
      <p>So you have about 4 years of experience with Ruby on Rails and a little over 2 years of experience working remotely. Can you explain a little more about these?</p>

      <p>I keep short and long term goals and accomplish them with tasks. I had a hard time keeping focus before I learned to do this. Also I communicate via email and chat for issues that don't need immediate attention, and set up video calls for more urgent matters. Remotely I've learned setup expectations with certain individuals that I may need to talk to them at any point in the day, this helps them know that if I talk to them it's urgent. Something special that I try to bring to the table is a team morale boosting attitude. I'm not always team lead, but I will always advocate for a positive team to work with for all of us.</p>

      <p>So what's next from here?</p>

      <p>Honestly, I'm looking for for full-time work and I'm hoping I'll get an <a href="mailto:me@dsperry.com">email</a> sooner than later. I'll be on my journey to be a full-service web developer either way. I'll keep picking up contracts and strengthening my skills that I think are out of balance. I'm simply trying to spend my days learning about web design and development, with people that aren't terrible, while making time to enjoy the little things in life.</p>
