I played video games,  
Youth, friends, and soda stains!  
So much fun!  
Still got pleanty of sun.  
I couldn't find a reason to complain!

You are getting closer to me,  
Timed for gradeschool you will be,  
I just want to know,  
If sun dyed snow,  
falls with more velocity?

Surely this is common truth,  
It is a little heavier, you goof!  
So much information,  
I need an explenation,  
All these ideas need proof!

Sure I could experiment... seems crazy,  
but money, and time, plus I'm lazy.  
I have learned so much,  
like how we are not in touch,  
The entertainment makes things hazy.

I saw my favorite person's thought!  
In between tens of inches of rot!  
In one hand, benefit?  
The other, get rid of it!  
I see now we are human, not bot!

The information pretty useful,  
I can not... will not... be untruthful.  
Issues come from these connections.  
It's an improper reflection.  
Take me back to when I was youthful.

You weren't even around back then.  
Connection through paper and pen.  
Actions like getting in your car,  
Effort goes really far,  
Making effort to care for a friend.

I'll get a house phone at best,  
I'll read emails, at work, I guess...  
Connection through senses,  
Digitally built fences,  
I won't waste these beats inside my chest.

Your information had its tries,  
You know your connections lies,  
My smiles are more real,  
My body will only feel,  
My favorite person with adoring eyes.
