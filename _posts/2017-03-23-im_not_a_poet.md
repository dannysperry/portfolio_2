I'm not a poet,
I think I'd blow it.

Break it into bits,
Crash it into crumbles.

I'm not a writer,
nor am I a fighter.
They know pain.

Drowned and drained,
Exposed but entertained,
Free to fly.

I think I could try,
I doubt I'd die.
I guess I could paint.
Is that my fate?

Endangered and eager,
Fatigued from too much fainting,
Guilty of gunlock.

I ache for my health,
I've tightened my belt,
I'm growing stronger,
I'll wait longer,
No matter what.

Hugs help,
Irrantants ignored?
Jokes jittering.

I'm all alone,
Time seems still,
Hard like a stone,
It is what it is,
which is very real.

Kicking kindly,
Likely lying,
Mighty but mortified.

I've risen up,
Through tons of muck,
that was definitely my fault,
I could have said no,
more times that I know.

Negavity negating
Operating with optimism,
Prominantly protective.

My life was successful,
Losing love was a lot,
All my child hood thoughts,
Were suddently not what I want.

Quitting questions,
Reunited with Rylee,
Suprising and satisfied.

I have everything I need,
Her smile,
That laugh,
My greatest gift's been underrepresented.

Time heals, Thoughts dont.
Unmasking uniqueness,
Valitdating vitality.

I've looked back,
It does not help.
Though when you are away,
the present is sad.
But I see brighter days,
watching your ways.

Writer's win,
Xenodochial,
Though youth fades yearly.

I'm a believer in magic,
I've seen into your eyes.
The man I am didn't just happen,
I've been tried,
It was a ride that's taught me to fly.

Zelous, zestful, zany;
a lot more than a zero.

I'm probably not done hurtin',
You see a hero.
I'm just a person.
I promise you all,
it might look like I'll fall,
but with her at my side,
filling up my pride,
in knowing that I've made sure you are smiling every single day of your life and I've been privilaged enough to watch it
